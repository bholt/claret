# Questions
- how to implement this?
    - in Grappa?
    - in Spark?
    - in an existing database?
        - Redis? ("data structures server", but not designed to be consistent across replicas)
	        - would people take this seriously if it was a modification to Redis?
        - Tapir?
        - Lynx (geo-replicated, explicit transaction chains)
        - Rococo (distributed key/value store, reorder pieces of transactions to ensure strict serializability)
    - Existing DTM framework
        - HyFlow (Scala)
- how best to evaluate?
    - data structure microbenchmarks
        - key/value store
        - kv with more interesting values (e.g. sets)
    - database workload
        - graph db?
    - web server workload (like phase-reconciliation paper)
- what's the minimal set of features to make this interesting?
    - combining ops w/o replication?
    - combining & replication w/o multi-object transactions?
    - all?
- What's the difference between "strict serializability" vs just "serializability"?
    - for instance, Rococo differentiates itself from Lynx this way (Rococo is strictly serializable, Lynx just serializable)
