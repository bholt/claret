# Questions
- how to implement this?
	- something in Spark?
	- in Grappa?
	- in an existing database (e.g. Postgres?)
- how best to evaluate?
	- data structure microbenchmarks
		- key/value store
		- kv with more interesting values (e.g. sets)
	- database workload
		- graph db?
	- web server workload (like phase-reconciliation paper)
- what's the minimal set of features to make this interesting?
    - combining ops w/o replication?
    - combining & replication w/o multi-object transactions?
