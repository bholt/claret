# Novelty
- *combining* operations in transactions
- generalization of phases: not just commutative and non-commutative, but which operations commute with other ops (also generalizes "commutative-requests-first" transaction reordering)
- generalizing "key-splitting" (proxy/replicas) for any supported data structure
